After working my 5th 12 hour shift in a row as the General Manager of a Restaurant in Santa Cruz, Ca, I finally came to the realization that I wanted to start looking at other possible career paths. I had gone to school for a Bio degree, but after working in that industry for several years and keeping my night time jobs in restaurants I decided that I was having more fun and making substantially more money bartending. I enjoyed the social interactions, creating new cocktails, and lighter hours compared to your typical 9-5. But after being in that industry since I was 15 years old, I am ready to step back! I wanted something that would challenge me, and I had already started to teach myself some basic HTML and things along those lines. After meeting with some UX designers. I shopped around for awhile while I looked for a bootcamp that would work with my schedule. )Being the GM of a restaurant can call for some strange & long hours). And here we are, excited for the challenges ahead, and the knowledge I will bring from it!
