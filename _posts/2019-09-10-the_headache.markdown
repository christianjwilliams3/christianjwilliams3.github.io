The struggle can be real, and the repitition of trying to find a small syntax error can be grueling. Although nothing is quite more satisfying than completeing the puzzle! When I find my self struggling I am quick to reach out to books I have purchased as reference guides, as well as github. I noticed that Syntax was something I really struggled with very much so when writing with variables and now adding multiple variables to the code. I find myself searching through my code line by line to see where I made a mistake. I at times get ahead of myself type to quickly and then notice my error while double checking my code. Other times im just looking at my computer screen in total loss! I do notice that my skills are growing quickly, and I am writing certain codes without even thinking twice. Then a curve ball comes my way and its back to the drawing board. When dealing with variables with intergers I have been hand writing essentially what i need to do mathematically down, and then creating an area of the keywords and symbols next to it that would create the method. This has been extremely helpful to give me a clear idea of everything I need to use within the code. Although at times I am removing bits that are overspecifc. But no matter what the code will eventually function, we all just gotta keep pushing through!
