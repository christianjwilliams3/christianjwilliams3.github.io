I am currently working on my CLI portfolio project. I have decided to set up my project around local veterinary hospitals that will then give thier information in return. I have created my classes and set up my environment. Now I am at the phase of continuing to test my code against the information I am receiving from my API. I decided to use an API as it is something to learn compared to what we have already done from scraping. Trial and error has been apart of learning so far and it is definetely no different than what I have done in previous lessons. This is no different!
