This first portfolio project was at the least to say difficult. I am on the self paced program and I have found this lesson far more difficult than any other lesson I have come across. Tests are our bigest allie!  Going into this blank canvas will make you second guess whole heartedly what you are doing. But it will take perserverance to create the postive work you want to create. All of our lessons have been built on tests, and going into this lesson without tests has become extremely difficult. I have questioned every ounce of code I have written regardless of how many pry"s I inputed.
I wish you all the best!
