Comprehension has been something I have stuggled with so far in my journey into programming. Charts and data are something I have always been comfortable with in programs like excel etc. Moving into SQL I feel as I am understanding that relationship with much more ease moreso than OOP. The relationships are much more clear and I can picture them in my head as I am writing the methods!
